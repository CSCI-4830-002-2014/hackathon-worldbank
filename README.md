# Objective 1. Custom Visualizations

## Initial Sketches

### Idea 1
![initial-sketch](sketch1.jpg?raw=true) 

Logan and Mike came up with the idea to make the points on the scatterplot crosses, with the length and heights representing different values.

### Idea 2

We forgot to grab a picture of our other sketch, but it wasn't really interesting in that we were doing nothing that a program like Tableau couldn't

## Final Sketches

Due to the rapid-ness of the class, we went ahead and just used the first sketch we made.


## Implementation

### Design 1

[d3 source code](test.html)

We had some troubles getting the data into d3 because of header permissions and d3's library's inability to use local files. This setback is what caused the few bugs that we did have.


# Objective 2. Public Display
